# Do not edit, downloaded from https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-health-monitor/raw/v0.2.0/deploy/kubernetes/external-health-monitor-agent/rbac.yaml
# for csi-driver-host-path v1.7.2
# by test/e2e/testing-manifests/storage-csi/update-hostpath.sh
#
# This YAML file contains all RBAC objects that are necessary to run external
# CSI health monitor agent.
#
# In production, each CSI driver deployment has to be customized:
# - to avoid conflicts, use non-default namespace and different names
#   for non-namespaced entities like the ClusterRole
# - decide whether the deployment replicates the external CSI
#   health monitor agent, in which case leadership election must be enabled;
#   this influences the RBAC setup, see below

kind: ServiceAccount

  name: csi-external-health-monitor-agent
